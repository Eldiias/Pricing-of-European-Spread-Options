# Pricing of European Spread Options
## Project performed during the Derivatives Pricing Course of Master program

Existence of various financial products is one of the features of the modern financial system. Many financial
derivatives are actively traded on different exchanges throughout the world. Most of these derivatives are
defined as exotic. Exotic options are considered to be the most common exotic products. In finance, an
exotic option is an option which has features making it more complex than commonly traded vanilla options.
Like the more general exotic derivatives they may have several triggers relating to determination of payoff.
An exotic option may also include non-standard underlying instrument, developed for a particular client or
for a particular market. Exotic options are more complex than options that trade on an exchange, and are
generally traded over the counter (OTC).

A large group of exotic options is related to non-standard specifications of underlying assets. One of
them is spread option whose payoff is based on the difference in price between two underlying assets. Spread
options are generally traded over the counter, rather than on exchange.

In this paper we study the main features of the European spread call and put options and investigate
the methods of pricing them. This report is organized in the following way. In the second section we give
a description to the main characteristics of spread options and illustrate different scenarios of payoffs of a
spread option depending on the asset price movements. We then analyze different approaches to pricing of
spread options and their implementation. Section 4 provides the investigation of sensitivity parameters of
spread options with respect to basis option characteristics. Additionally, a modification of standard spread
option specification is introduced in the paper. This modification is based on the redefining of spread in prices
of underlying assets. We show that most of sensitivity parameters change their functional forms compared
to the standard setting. The final section concludes the discussion.
